# Weather Report

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project which allows users to view the weather as well as additional forecast and allows users to add or delete a location.

## Why I Built This

Weather Report is a web application for those who like to look ahead and want to check the weather before going out! Before building Weather Forecast I always dressed for the occasion, but always failed to dress for the weather. Now with Weather Forecast I look ahead and reader for any type of weather! Besides wanting to dress for the weather, being able to see the weather ahead of time gives me time to build precaution for anytype of aggressive weather, whether it be a snow storm, a thunderstorm, and even a siclone, with Weather Forecast i'm able to get live alerts, which allows me to always know what's coming and you can as well by pasting the following link into your browser!
